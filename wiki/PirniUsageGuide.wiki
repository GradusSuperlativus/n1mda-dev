= Introduction =

pirni is the worlds first native network sniffer for iPhone.
The iPhone's wifi has some major drawbacks in it's hardware design, thus we can not properly set the device in promiscious mode.

This is why pirni comes with an ARP spoofer.


===Usage:===

pirni -i en0 -s 192.168.0.1 -b 255.255.255.255 -f “tcp dst port 80″

*-i* is the *i*nterface, for iPhone the wireless interface is called en0

*-s* is the *s*ource adress, the MAC adress you want to spoof. In most cases, the router.

*-b* is the *b*roadcast adress, you may want to look this up. But in most cases it would be 255.255.255.255

-f is the BPF *f*ilter you want to supply to the sniffer. This is very good if you want to filter out specific packets - such as FTP, SMTP or HTTP. Simply supply “” if you want to capture all packets.
