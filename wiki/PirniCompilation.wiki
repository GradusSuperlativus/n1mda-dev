#How to compile Pirni from sources.

= Introduction =

This document is about the two ways you can compile pirni, both ON your iPhone or cross compiling with the toolchain. If anyone wants to add instructions for the SDK, go ahead and leave a comment :)


*If you're in no need to compile your own version, pirni is available in the BigBoss repository on Cydia. Tap and install, that's it*

==Native way - On your iPhone==
Download the latest sources from this subversion:
{{{
svn checkout http://n1mda-dev.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pirni/ pirni
}}}

Transfer all the files to your iPhone and SSH in to it (or do it locally with mobileterminal)

In order to compile you need to install _libnet_ and _libpcap_ from Cydia. You might have to change your settings to "Hacker" in order for this packages to show up in the Cydia listings. You may also install these packages directly from the command line:

{{{
sudo apt-get install libnet libpcap
}}}
{{{
cd pirni
make
cp pirni /usr/bin/
}}}

You can now delete the source from your device. Done.

==Cross compilation: arm-apple-darwin9-gcc==
Coming soon.
